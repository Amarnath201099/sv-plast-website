        <h3>Why SV PLAST</h3>
        <p>
          SV PLAST Gypsum plaster has proved to be a grade-one plastering
          material — highly durable and reliable. It is a carefully processed
          gypsum plaster imported directly from the mines in Iran.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every 25kg gypsum bag you receive undergoes several quality curation
          steps like pulverization, sieving, hardening, and strengthening. We
          deliver fine 200-mesh gypsum powder, considered top-tier in quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using sand, cement, and putty for internal plastering is outdated.
          Switch to the miracle of gypsum plaster with SV PLAST.
